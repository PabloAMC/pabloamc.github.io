# Pledging to give

Last 26th of October, 2024, I committed to donating at least 10% of my income to highly effective causes. Specifically the pledge says

> I recognise that I can use part of my income to do a significant amount of good. Since I can live well enough on a smaller income, I pledge that from 2024-10-26 and for the rest of my life or until the day I retire, I shall give at least 10% of
> what I earn to whichever organisations can most effectively use it to improve the lives of others. I make this pledge freely, openly, and sincerely.

This is a significant comitment but one I believe I will become proud of in the future. But this is not the reason why I do it. I have pledge to donate because there are people who need the resources much more than I do, and I recognise that my contribution can do large amounts of good in absolute terms even if small in relative terms. The world is not fair, and I will not solve all problems, even if I am and will likely remain among world's 5% richest people. But perhaps I can solve some problems. I would like to be the person who cares about others, about happiness, joy and humanity. I believe there are children whose lives and smiles are worth fighting for, even if I will never know them.

Thus, [this pledge](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge) is a pledge to dedicating my resources for these values that I hold, and for those who are not as lucky as I am. I invite you to learn more and consider it for yourself.
